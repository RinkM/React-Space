# React Practice and Learning Space

## App Goal
Goal was to use this file's contents and display it in various ways. 
I created something comparable to a user directory but decided to go with a Robot Dating Site. 
This app uses a JSON data file of users which includes : 
- Name
- Email
- Avatar picture link
- Id #



## Learning Objectives 
- create a React App.
- use bootstrap components to display JSON user information.
- build components using classes and functions.
- incorporate hooks into these function components. 
- build and validate forms.
- use Redux to manage changes in the app.
- display changes in app 
- Find a date for Friday night.

## Summary of Learning
The pattern for building this "app" was very similar. With the help of a friend or using online tutorials, I would build some practice components (searchForm, Welcome, ClockClasses).  Then, I would try to extend this into more complicated components that would interact with the fake user information.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
